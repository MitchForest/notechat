## Getting Started {#getting-started}

### Your First Note

1. **Create a Space**: Click the "+" button in the sidebar to create your first space. Think of spaces as top-level folders for different areas of your life (Work, Personal, Learning, etc.)

2. **Add a Collection**: Inside a space, create collections to group related notes. For example, in a "Learning" space, you might have collections for different courses.

3. **Create a Note**: Click "New Note" or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + N`. Give it a meaningful title and start writing!

### The Editor

NoteChat uses a block-based editor similar to Notion. Each paragraph, heading, or list is a "block" that you can:
- **Drag and drop** to reorganize (hover near the left edge to see the drag handle)
- **Format** using the toolbar or keyboard shortcuts
- **Transform** using AI assistance

## Writing with AI Assistance {#ai-writing}

### Ghost Text Completions {#ghost-text}

NoteChat can help you write by suggesting completions as you type. Here's how it works:

1. **Trigger**: Type `++` anywhere in your note
2. **Wait**: Ghost text will appear in gray, suggesting how to complete your thought
3. **Accept or Reject**:
   - Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion
   - Press `Escape` or `Enter` to reject it
   - Just keep typing to ignore it

**Example:**
```
I'm learning about machine learning and ++
[Ghost text appears: "exploring neural networks and deep learning concepts"]
```

**Tips:**
- Ghost text works best when you've written at least a few words to provide context
- The more you use it, the better it gets at matching your writing style
- It's particularly helpful for completing technical explanations or continuing lists

### Slash Commands {#slash-commands}
