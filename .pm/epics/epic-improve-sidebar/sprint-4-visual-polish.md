# Sprint 4: Visual Polish & Drag/Drop

## Goal
Fix visual layout issues, improve active state styling, clarify drag/drop behavior, and ensure consistent spacing throughout the sidebar.

## Problem Statement
Current visual issues:
- Chevrons not aligned to the far right
- Weak active state indication
- Unclear drag/drop rules for smart collections
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment
- No smooth transitions
- **Editor drag handle not working**

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Fix Chevron Alignment (1 hour) ✅
**Files**: All expandable components

- ✅ Verified space-section has proper `justify-between`
- ✅ Verified sidebar-collection-item has proper structure
- ✅ Verified smart-collection-item has proper alignment
- ✅ All chevrons consistently aligned to far right
- ✅ Added `ml-2` spacing for breathing room

### Task 2: Improve Active State Styling (2 hours) ✅
**File**: `app/globals.css`

- ✅ Enhanced `.sidebar-item-active-accent` with stronger visual
- ✅ Added background color (`hover-2`) for active items
- ✅ Increased border width from 3px to 4px
- ✅ Added subtle box-shadow glow on accent border
- ✅ Added scale animation on activation
- ✅ Active items don't change on hover
- ✅ Smooth transitions (150ms) for all state changes

### Task 3: Visual Drag/Drop Indicators (2 hours) ✅
**File**: `features/organization/hooks/use-drag-drop.ts`

- ✅ Added `getDragOverStyles` function
- ✅ Valid drop: Blue dashed border + light blue background
- ✅ Invalid drop: Red tinted background + not-allowed cursor
- ✅ Smart collections show tooltip when dragged over
- ✅ Added drag state to smart-collection-item
- ✅ Smooth transitions for drag states

### Task 4: Smooth Expand/Collapse Animations (1 hour) ✅
**File**: Create `features/organization/components/animated-collapse.tsx`

- ✅ Installed framer-motion
- ✅ Created AnimatedCollapse component
- ✅ Respects prefers-reduced-motion
- ✅ Height animation with smooth easing
- ✅ Opacity fade for content
- ✅ Applied to all expandable sections
- ✅ 200ms duration for smooth feel

### Task 4.5: Editor Drag Handle Migration (3 hours) ✅
**Files**: Editor extensions and styles

- ✅ Created custom `BlockDragHandle` extension
- ✅ Removed non-functional Tiptap drag handle
- ✅ Implemented mouse tracking with throttling
- ✅ Dynamic positioning that follows cursor
- ✅ Drag and drop with visual feedback
- ✅ Drop indicator showing where block will land
- ✅ Cleaned up old CSS and unused files
- ✅ All tests passing

**Technical Details:**
- Uses direct DOM manipulation instead of Tippy.js
- Single drag handle element that moves around
- Mouse tracking with 16ms throttle (~60fps)
- Hover zones with 100ms hide delay
- Native HTML5 drag with ProseMirror integration
- Fixed positioning to avoid scroll issues

### Task 5: Fix Spacing and Alignment (1 hour) ⏳
- ⏳ Define CSS custom properties
- ⏳ Apply consistent spacing
- ⏳ Fix text alignment

### Task 6: Add Loading Skeletons (1 hour) ⏳
- ⏳ Create SidebarSkeleton component
- ⏳ Show during initial load
- ⏳ Prevent layout shift

## Session Summary

**Completed:**
- Verified chevron alignment is already correct across all components
- Dramatically improved active state styling with stronger visual indicators
- Added comprehensive drag/drop visual feedback
- Implemented smooth expand/collapse animations with framer-motion
- **Implemented custom editor drag handle that properly follows mouse**
- All animations respect user's motion preferences
- Fixed TypeScript and linting issues

**Files Changed:**
- `modified: app/globals.css` - Enhanced active state styling and animations
- `modified: features/organization/hooks/use-drag-drop.ts` - Added visual feedback functions
- `modified: features/organization/components/smart-collection-item.tsx` - Added drag tooltip
- `created: features/organization/components/animated-collapse.tsx` - Smooth animations
- `modified: features/organization/components/space-section.tsx` - Use AnimatedCollapse
- `modified: features/organization/components/sidebar-collection-item.tsx` - Use AnimatedCollapse
- `modified: features/organization/components/smart-collection-item.tsx` - Use AnimatedCollapse
- `created: features/editor/extensions/block-drag-handle.ts` - Custom drag handle
- `modified: features/editor/config/extensions.ts` - Use custom extension
- `modified: features/editor/styles/drag-handle.css` - Updated styles
- `deleted: features/editor/extensions/custom-drag-handle.ts` - Removed unused
- `deleted: features/editor/styles/novel-drag-handle.css` - Removed unused

**Visual Improvements:**
- Active items now have:
  - Stronger background color
  - Thicker accent border (4px)
  - Subtle glow effect
  - Scale animation on activation
  - No hover state changes
- Drag operations show:
  - Blue dashed border for valid drops
  - Red background for invalid drops
  - Tooltip explaining smart collections
- Smooth 200ms animations for expand/collapse
- **Editor drag handle that follows the cursor**

**Remaining:**
- Task 5: Define consistent spacing variables
- Task 6: Add loading skeletons

## Notes

Sprint 4 is making excellent progress! The sidebar now has professional polish with smooth animations, clear visual feedback, and strong active state indicators. The drag/drop experience is much clearer with visual cues for valid/invalid drops. 

**Most importantly**, we've successfully implemented a custom drag handle for the editor that properly tracks mouse movement and allows dragging blocks around - solving the long-standing issue with the stationary handle.
