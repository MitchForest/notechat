# Sprint 3: Complete Hover Actions

## Goal
Finish all hover menu functionality with consistent positioning, proper actions for all item types, and a new change icon dialog.

## Problem Statement
Several hover actions are incomplete or have TODO comments:
- Change icon for collections not implemented
- Inconsistent positioning (`right-7` vs `right-8`)
- Smart collections missing change icon option
- Some actions not properly wired up

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Change Icon Dialog (2 hours) ✅
**File**: `features/organization/components/change-icon-dialog.tsx`

- ✅ Created dialog with icon categories
- ✅ 8 categories with 8 icons each
- ✅ Grid layout with selection state
- ✅ Smooth icon selection UX
- ✅ Works for both collections and smart collections

### Task 2: Update Hover Actions Component (1 hour) ✅
**File**: `features/organization/components/hover-actions.tsx`

- ✅ Fixed positioning to use consistent `right-1`
- ✅ Added change icon for smart collections
- ✅ Added smart-collection variant
- ✅ Updated delete text for smart collections ("Filter")
- ✅ Added move to space option for collections

### Task 3: Wire Up Change Icon Actions (2 hours) ✅
**File**: `components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx`

- ✅ Added change icon dialog state
- ✅ Implemented handleCollectionAction for changeIcon
- ✅ Implemented handleSmartCollectionAction for changeIcon
- ✅ Connected to store update methods
- ✅ Dialog opens with current icon selected

### Task 4: Fix Positioning Consistency (1 hour) ✅
**Files**: All components using hover actions

- ✅ Updated draggable-note-item from `right-0` to `right-1`
- ✅ Verified all other components use `right-1`
- ✅ Consistent positioning across all hover actions

### Task 5: Add Move to Space Dialog (2 hours) ✅
**File**: `features/organization/components/move-to-space-dialog.tsx`

- ✅ Created dialog with space selection
- ✅ Radio group for space selection
- ✅ Shows emoji and name for each space
- ✅ Filters out system spaces and current space
- ✅ Proper empty state when no spaces available

### Task 6: Complete All TODO Actions (1 hour) ✅
- ✅ Wired up move to space for collections
- ✅ Implemented change icon functionality
- ✅ All hover actions now functional
- ✅ Proper error handling with toast notifications

## Visual Improvements ✅

1. **Hover State Timing**
- ✅ Added `.hover-actions-trigger` CSS class
- ✅ Smooth opacity transitions (200ms)
- ✅ Stays visible when dropdown is open

2. **Active State for Dropdown**
- ✅ Dropdown stays visible when open
- ✅ Proper z-index handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Change icon dialog works for collections and smart collections
- ✅ All hover actions have consistent positioning (right-1)
- ✅ Move to space dialog implemented and working
- ✅ All TODO comments removed and actions implemented
- ✅ Proper error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Loading states for async operations (via store optimistic updates)
- ✅ Smooth hover transitions
- ✅ Keyboard accessible (tab navigation via shadcn components)

## Testing Results

1. ✅ Each action works for each item type
2. ✅ Icon changes persist (stored in database)
3. ✅ Move operations work correctly
4. ✅ Error handling shows toast notifications
5. ✅ Keyboard navigation works (built into shadcn)
6. ⏳ Touch devices need testing (long press)

## Session Summary

**Completed:**
- Created comprehensive change icon dialog with 64 icons in 8 categories
- Updated hover actions to support all variants (space, collection, smart-collection, item)
- Fixed positioning consistency across all components
- Created move to space dialog for collections
- Wired up all actions to their respective store methods
- Added smooth CSS transitions for hover states
- All TypeScript and linting checks pass

**Files Changed:**

## Notes

Sprint 3 is complete! All hover actions are now fully functional. The sidebar has comprehensive context menus for all item types with consistent positioning and smooth transitions. The change icon dialog provides a rich selection of icons organized by category, and the move to space dialog makes it easy to reorganize collections.
