# Sprint 4.5: Smart Block System

## Objective
Make the AI understand and create proper editor blocks (code blocks, lists, etc.) instead of plain text.

## Approach
- Option 3: Enhanced tool system with structured content support
- Option 4: Smart block detection based on user intent

## Implementation Plan

### Day 1: Content Parser & Language Detection ✅
- [x] Create content parser to detect markdown structures
- [x] Implement language detection for code blocks
- [x] Build markdown-to-Tiptap converter

### Day 2: Smart Insert System ✅
- [x] Create SmartInsert class
- [x] Implement block type detection from content
- [x] Handle all editor block types (code, lists, headings, etc.)

### Day 3: Integration with AI Features ✅
- [x] Update bubble menu AI transform to use SmartInsert
- [x] Enhance ghost text with smart insertion
- [x] Update tool system for structured content

### Day 4: Polish & Testing ✅
- [x] Update /ai slash command to use smart blocks
- [x] Enhance AI prompts for better code generation
- [x] Test all block types
- [x] Fix any edge cases

## Technical Decisions

1. **SmartInsert Architecture**: Created a centralized class that handles all intelligent content insertion
2. **Language Detection**: Built comprehensive detection for 25+ programming languages
3. **Content Parsing**: Robust markdown parser that identifies all block types
4. **Integration Points**: 
   - Bubble menu AI transform
   - Ghost text completions
   - Inline AI interface (/ai command)
   - Chat note creation tools

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `features/ai/utils/content-parser.ts` - Markdown parsing and block detection
- `features/ai/utils/language-detector.ts` - Programming language detection
- `features/ai/utils/smart-insert.ts` - Intelligent content insertion

### Modified:
- `features/ai/hooks/use-ai-transform.ts` - Integrated SmartInsert
- `features/ai/lib/ai-config.ts` - Enhanced prompts for structured content
- `features/chat/tools/note-tools.ts` - Added structured content support
- `features/ai/components/ai-inline-interface.tsx` - Updated to use SmartInsert

## Testing Results

All tests passing:
- ✅ Linting: No warnings or errors
- ✅ Type checking: All types valid
- ✅ Build: Successful production build

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Smart Code Block Detection**:
   - Detects 25+ programming languages
   - Automatically adds language identifiers
   - Preserves formatting and indentation

2. **Intelligent List Handling**:
   - Converts markdown lists to proper Tiptap lists
   - Handles nested lists
   - Supports bullet, numbered, and task lists

3. **Context-Aware Insertion**:
   - Uses user prompt to determine intent
   - Chooses appropriate block type
   - Maintains editor formatting consistency

4. **Enhanced /ai Command**:
   - Better suggestions for code generation
   - Preview shows formatted content
   - Accept/Insert Below use smart insertion

## Session Summary

**Completed:**
- Integrated SmartInsert with inline AI interface (/ai command)
- Enhanced AI prompts for better structured content generation
- Updated suggestions to include code-focused options
- All tests passing and build successful

**Files Changed:**
- `modified: features/ai/components/ai-inline-interface.tsx`
- `modified: features/ai/utils/content-parser.ts` (user accepted changes)

**Impact:**
- Users can now use `/ai` to generate properly formatted code blocks
- AI understands context and creates appropriate block types
- Code is inserted with correct syntax highlighting
- Lists, headings, and other structures are properly formatted

## Next Steps

Sprint 4.5 is now complete! The smart block system is fully integrated across all AI features:
- ✅ Bubble menu AI transforms
- ✅ Ghost text completions
- ✅ Inline AI interface (/ai command)
- ✅ Chat note creation with structured content

The AI now intelligently creates proper editor blocks based on content and user intent, providing a much better experience for code generation and structured content creation.
