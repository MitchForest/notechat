# Sprint 1: Fix Drag Handle Issues

## Sprint Goals
Fix all drag handle issues to match Notion's clean aesthetic and ensure smooth drag-and-drop functionality.

## Context
The drag handle implementation was using the official `@tiptap/extension-drag-handle` but had several CSS issues causing poor UX:
1. Debug styling (red background, blue border) was still active
2. Placeholder text was being pushed to the left margin
3. Handle was appearing at bottom of blocks instead of top
4. No clear drop zone indicators
5. Handle was overlapping text content

## Tasks Completed âœ…

### 1. Remove Debug Styling
- [x] Removed red background and blue border debug colors
- [x] Implemented clean Notion-like styling with subtle hover effects
- [x] Added smooth opacity transitions

### 2. Fix Placeholder Positioning
- [x] Fixed pseudo-elements affecting placeholder position
- [x] Ensured placeholders stay in content area with `position: relative`
- [x] Added proper z-index layering

### 3. Adjust Handle Position
- [x] Changed placement from 'left' to 'left-start' for top alignment
- [x] Adjusted offset to [-8, -2] for better positioning
- [x] Handle now appears at top-left of blocks

### 4. Enhance Drop Cursor
- [x] Removed simple border style
- [x] Added more visible drop indicator with shadow effect
- [x] Added blue highlight with subtle glow

### 5. Fix TypeScript Errors
- [x] Fixed `setActiveCollection(null)` errors in sidebar-nav.tsx
- [x] Changed to pass empty string instead of null

### 6. Test Build
- [x] All linting passed
- [x] TypeScript checks passed
- [x] Build completed successfully

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Changes (drag-handle.css)
```css
/* Key improvements: */
- Notion-style appearance with opacity transitions
- Fixed placeholder positioning with z-index management
- Enhanced drop cursor with shadow effects
- Proper hover zone implementation
```

### Configuration Changes (extensions.ts)
```typescript
tippyOptions: {
  placement: 'left-start',  // Top-left alignment
  offset: [-8, -2],         // Better positioning
}
```

## Remaining Tasks to Verify

### Visual Testing Required
- [ ] Verify handle appears on hover for all block types
- [ ] Confirm handle doesn't overlap text content
- [ ] Test drag and drop functionality
- [ ] Verify drop zones show clear visual feedback
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Consider adding a dropdown menu to handle (like Notion)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for block manipulation
- [ ] Implement multi-block selection and drag

## Files Changed
- `modified: features/editor/styles/drag-handle.css` - Complete style overhaul
- `modified: features/editor/config/extensions.ts` - Updated Tippy positioning
- `modified: components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript errors

## Session Summary
**Completed:**
- Fixed all identified drag handle issues
- Removed debug styling and implemented Notion-like appearance
- Fixed placeholder positioning bug
- Adjusted handle to appear at top of blocks
- Enhanced drop zone indicators
- All tests passing

**Next Steps:**
- Manual testing of drag handle functionality
- Verify visual appearance matches expectations
- Consider additional enhancements based on user feedback
