## Key Decisions Made
- Use existing app/page.tsx conditional rendering instead of route groups
- Maintain minimal design aesthetic without gradients
- Focus on typography and subtle animations
- Emphasize block editor and AI features equally

## Active Files
- `components/layout/landing-page.tsx` - Main landing page component
- `components/landing/` - All landing page sections and components
- `.pm/epics/epic-11-landing/` - Sprint documentation

## Notes
- Landing page now shows when user is not logged in
- All tests passing (lint, typecheck, build)
- Ready to continue with Sprint 6

## Key Features to Highlight (Updated)
1. **Notion-Style Block Editor** - Drag-and-drop blocks with slash commands
2. **AI-Powered Chat** - Converse with your entire knowledge base
3. **Smart Organization** - Spaces and collections
4. **Adaptive Ghost Completions** - AI that learns your writing style
5. **Custom AI Commands** - Personalize tone, reading level, audience
6. **Advanced Grammar Check** - Sophisticated error detection and style suggestions

## Key Differentiators
- **Familiar yet Enhanced**: Notion-style blocks with deep AI integration
- **AI That Learns**: Completions get smarter based on what you accept/reject
- **Customizable AI**: Create your own AI commands for specific needs
- **Integrated Experience**: No switching between apps - AI understands your entire workspace
- **Privacy First**: AI learns from you but never shares your data
