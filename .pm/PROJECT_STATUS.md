## Previous Work (Epic 11 - Landing Page)

## Sidebar Issues Progress
1. âœ… **Active State**: Unified active context implemented
2. ðŸ”„ **Smart Collections**: Not expandable (Sprint 2)
3. **Hover Actions**: Incomplete (Sprint 3)
4. **Empty States**: Inconsistent (Sprint 2/4)
5. **Item Display**: Smart collections don't show items (Sprint 2)

## Key Decisions Made

- Visual indicator (left accent border) provides clear feedback
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes
