## Next Steps
1. Review implementation plan
2. Prioritize sprints if needed
3. Begin Sprint 1: Unified Active State Management

## Sidebar Issues Identified
1. **Active State**: Multiple stores tracking active states independently
2. **Smart Collections**: Not expandable/collapsible
3. **Hover Actions**: Incomplete implementations
4. **Empty States**: Inconsistent handling
5. **Item Display**: Smart collections don't show filtered items

## Key Decisions Made
- Implement unified active context system
- Make smart collections fully expandable
- Complete all hover action implementations
- Standardize visual indicators and spacing
- Add comprehensive testing suite

## Active Files
- `.pm/epics/epic-improve-sidebar/README.md` - Epic overview
- `.pm/epics/epic-improve-sidebar/sprint-1-unified-active-state.md`
- `.pm/epics/epic-improve-sidebar/sprint-2-smart-collection-expansion.md`
- `.pm/epics/epic-improve-sidebar/sprint-3-complete-hover-actions.md`
- `.pm/epics/epic-improve-sidebar/sprint-4-visual-polish.md`
- `.pm/epics/epic-improve-sidebar/sprint-5-testing-documentation.md`

## Notes
- Epic focuses on critical UX improvements

- Total estimated duration: 7 days
