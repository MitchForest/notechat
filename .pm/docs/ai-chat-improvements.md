- Auto-scroll behavior
- Mobile responsiveness

---

## 2. Message Pagination âœ…

**Status:** Complete (100%)

**Implementation:**
- [x] Created messages table with proper indexes
- [x] Built paginated API endpoint (`/api/chats/[chatId]/messages`)
- [x] Implemented cursor-based pagination
- [x] Created useMessagePagination hook
- [x] Added "Load earlier messages" UI
- [x] Implemented infinite scroll trigger
- [x] Fixed Next.js 15 params Promise issue

**Details:**
- 50 messages per page
- Cursor-based pagination for consistency

## 3. Auto-Delete After 30 Days âœ…

**Status:** Complete (100%)

**Implementation:**
- [x] Add `deletedAt` column to chats table
- [x] Create cleanup API endpoint (`/api/cleanup`)
- [x] Implement soft delete after 30 days (non-starred chats)
- [x] Implement hard delete after 37 days (7-day recovery window)
- [x] Add recovery endpoint (`/api/chats/recover`)
- [x] Filter soft-deleted chats from UI
- [x] Create test script for manual cleanup
- [x] Configure Vercel cron job

**Vercel Setup:**
1. **Environment Variable**: Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel dashboard
   ```bash
   # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
   CRON_SECRET=your-generated-secret
   ```

2. **Cron Configuration**: Added to `vercel.json`
   - Runs daily at midnight UTC
   - Endpoint: `/api/cleanup`
   - Authentication via Bearer token

3. **Manual Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Check pending cleanups
   curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cleanup?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
   
   # Run cleanup manually
   curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cleanup?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
   ```

**Behavior:**
- Soft delete: Sets `deletedAt` timestamp after 30 days
- Recovery window: 7 days after soft delete
- Hard delete: Permanent removal after 37 days total
- Starred chats are never auto-deleted
- Messages are cascade deleted with chats
