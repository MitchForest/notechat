### Additional Fixes Completed

#### Active State Styling

- Active items show with `bg-hover-1` background
- Users can now see which space/collection is currently active

#### Fix Items Not Showing Under Collections
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Fixed `getFilteredItems` to use ALL notes and chats instead of just space items
- Collections now properly show all their items regardless of which space they're in

## Remaining Tasks ❌
