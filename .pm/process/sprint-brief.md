   - Say: "I'll begin by reading all the context documents..."
   - Follow ai-workflow.md EXACTLY

## Pre-Sprint Checklist

### Reality Check
Before diving in, quickly assess:
- [ ] Is this still the right feature to build?
- [ ] Have requirements changed since planning?
- [ ] Any new technical constraints discovered?
- [ ] Better approach available based on recent learnings?

### Propose Testing Level
Based on the sprint goal, propose:
- **Level 1 (Standard)**: Lint, type-check, build, unit/integration tests

Recommend: [Level X] because [reasoning]

### Improvement Opportunities
